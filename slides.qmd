# Working on many PRs at once is hard

* Dependent changes are hard to model
* It's easy to become blocked when waiting for a PR to be reviewed

# Graphite

A CLI tool that helps you keep commits small through a concept known as...

## Stacked Changes

Stacked changes are a concept used in many tools like:

* Critique at Google
* Phabricator at Facebook
* Code Review at Amazon
* Many open source implementations exist

# Stacked Changes

Stacked changes essentially allow you to review a _diff_ instead of a _commit_

## Stacked Changes

There's a very subtle difference between a diff and a commit. The main benefit is that you can submit review changes based on work that is yet to be merged

## Stacks

This means that you can split up one large feature branch into several smallers PRs and have them reviewed in parallel

# Graphite

Handles all of the rebasing required to manage stacked commits
